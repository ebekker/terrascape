# README - experiments

This folder contains the original (legacy) experiments in creating support for
.NET-based GoPlugin and Terrascape plugin support.  While the _Terrascape_
project can still be considered an experiment as a whole, the pieces in here
were built upon the older GRPC support for C# and .NET (pre-ASP.NET Core 3.x
support) and was built and tested again the 0.11 and early 0.12 (pre-release)
version of the Terraform plugin model.

These projects have been relocated here temporarily as a reference to the
older code, but once the newer versions are more stabilized, all of these
legacy versions can be removed.

This folder will also contain any future POCs and prototypes for future ideas.
