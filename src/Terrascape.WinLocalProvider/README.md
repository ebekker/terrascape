# README - 'WinLocalProvider' TF Plugin

This is an example of a TF Plugin Provider implemented in C# targeting functionality
specific to a target platform.

This plugin is similar to the _general-purpose plugin [LocalProvider](../Terrascape.LocalProvider)
but provides resources that are specific to a Windows host.
